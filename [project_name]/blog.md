# Inspirationüí°
Whenever we sign up on educational platforms we always need to sign up to use anything.No feature is usable without signing up. That's a huge concern for us these days. We really care about privacy and protecting our credentials. So we decided to make a  platform for all your educational needs that doesn't require a sign up or anything. We have added a lot of features to EduHub. Also we sometimes felt a need for a news notification service that's completely open-source and provides you with daily news notifications about your desired topic. We always thought that it would make our lives easier as students as we can get news notifications about anything we are learning or want to learn about. Like when I was trying to learn about astrophysics I felt a need for an email service that would give me the latest news about astrophysics or anything I want to learn about.

# How we built it‚ùì
We built it using Courier's API ,Firebase ,Replit ,Flask and Python. We used Courier's API for our platform's email notifications, Firebase for storing the data online, Replit for developing our app and hosting our Backend and Flask as our Backend. It was a fun experience building it.

# Challenges we ran intoüé¢
We were quite new to Courier and Firebase so the learning curve was steep but Courier Docs were very well written that helped us to learn the API and features quickly.

# Accomplishments that we are proud of
That we were successful in building our project exactly what we desired and it works quite well.

# What we learnedüìö
We learned about how to send emails using Courier's API and Courier Elemental. Courier‚Äôs API was very easy to use  and quick. Courier Elemental made it very easy for us to beautify our email response and gave a very good response to our users. We also learned about how to use firebase to store  data and retrieve it using a python flask.

# Hostingüë©‚Äçüè´
We hosted our website on GitHub pages and we hosted our backend on Replit

# What's next for EduHub
We want to add more  features and want to try out Courier's Automation API in Future
