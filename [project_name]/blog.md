# Inspirationüí°
Whenever we sign up on educational platforms we always need to sign up to use anything.No feature is usable without signing up. That's a huge concern for us these days. We really care about privacy and protecting our credentials. So we decided to make a  platform for all your educational needs that doesn't require a sign up or anything. We have added a lot of features to EduHub. Also we sometimes felt a need for a news notification service that's completely open-source and provides you with daily news notifications about your desired topic. We always thought that it would make our lives easier as students as we can get news notifications about anything we are learning or want to learn about. Like when I was trying to learn about astrophysics I felt a need for an email service that would give me the latest news about astrophysics or anything I want to learn about.

# How we built it‚ùì
We built it using Courier's API ,Firebase ,Replit ,Flask and Python. We used Courier's API for our platform's email notifications, Firebase for storing the data online, Replit for developing our app and hosting our Backend and Flask as our Backend. It was a fun experience building it.

# Challenges we ran intoüé¢
We were quite new to Courier and Firebase so the learning curve was steep but Courier Docs were very well written that helped us to learn the API and features quickly.

# Accomplishments that we are proud of
That we were successful in building our project exactly what we desired and it works quite well.

# What we learnedüìö
We learned about how to send emails using Courier's API and Courier Elemental. Courier‚Äôs API was very easy to use  and quick. Courier Elemental made it very easy for us to beautify our email response and gave a very good response to our users. We also learned about how to use firebase to store  data and retrieve it using a python flask.

# Hostingüë©‚Äçüè´
We hosted our website on GitHub pages and we hosted our backend on Replit

# What's next for EduHub
We want to add more  features and want to try out Courier's Automation API in Future

# Message from developers

This is an open-source project. Feel Free to Fork it or Make Pull Requests to this project. We would love it if anyone wanted to contribute to this project and want to help in creating a perfect student platform. You can contact us at cyrixninja#0157 or ninnza#2681 if you got any doubts regarding implementing any new feature in this project. You should host each app individually and add their iframe in their respective HTML page. We used replit for hosting, you can use any services you like. If you face any difficulty in testing or usage, you can contact us for files with API or for our API keys. You can also use node js, go, or any programming language. Since the main page is static and features are embedded in the main page you can use always add a page with a hosted backend in any programming language and it would work flawlessly.
We can't wait to see how this platform turns out in the future. Thanks for showing your interest in our project.üòÅ

Courier API- Courier provides app-to-user notifications and is  central to our app as it is based totally on receiving Email Notification.We used <a href="https://www.courier.com/docs/elemental/">Courier Elemental </a> for our app to user notifications.It provides really good and quick notification to our users.

Python Flask- Flask serves as an backend to our project

Firebase Realtime Database- We used it as an database to store user data.It's very safe and secure to use.

Cohere's NLP API- We used to generate responses in our AI Advice Feature.
