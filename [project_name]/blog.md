# Inspirationüí°
Whenever we sign up on educational platforms we always need to sign up to use anything.No feature is usable without signing up. That's a huge concern for us these days. We really care about privacy and protecting our credentials. So we decided to make a  platform for all your educational needs that doesn't require a sign up or anything. We have added a lot of features to EduHub. Also we sometimes felt a need for a news notification service that's completely open-source and provides you with daily news notifications about your desired topic. We always thought that it would make our lives easier as students as we can get news notifications about anything we are learning or want to learn about. Like when I was trying to learn about astrophysics I felt a need for an email service that would give me the latest news about astrophysics or anything I want to learn about.

# Message from developers

This is an open-source project. Feel Free to Fork it or Make Pull Requests to this project. We would love it if anyone wanted to contribute to this project and want to help in creating a perfect student platform. You can contact us at cyrixninja#0157 or ninnza#2681 if you got any doubts regarding implementing any new feature in this project. You should host each app individually and add their iframe in their respective HTML page. We used replit for hosting, you can use any services you like. If you face any difficulty in testing or usage, you can contact us for files with API or for our API keys. You can also use node js, go, or any programming language. Since the main page is static and features are embedded in the main page you can use always add a page with a hosted backend in any programming language and it would work flawlessly.
We can't wait to see how this platform turns out in the future. Thanks for showing your interest in our project.üòÅ
